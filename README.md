### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Klaus Dieter Kupper**. I'm a **Control and Automation engineering** student at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, also engaged in a **FullStack Development** Bootcamp at Driven Education.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development on Driven, and at the university I'm learning Operating System Concepts, system integration via SQL and virtual machines.
- âš¡ I have experience working as a **prototype developer** (coding and assemblying), in microprocessors projects using Esp8266 and Arduino, also as a **junior entrepreneur at Integre JÃºnior, selling and developing websites and systems**. In both those experiences besides improving my coding skills I was able to improve a lot of my team work and communication skills, also got familiarized with many management techniques and production softwares, as **SCRUM, Trello, Rock, Slack, Ploomes, Canva and Wordpress**.
